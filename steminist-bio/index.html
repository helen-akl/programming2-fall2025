	<p> <b>Dorothy Hodgkin</b> was an influential English chemist, famous for discovering the atomic and molecular structures of penicillin and Vitamin B12. She was born on May 12, 1910 in Cairo, Egypt, where her father was working. She was sent to England to study, and eventually attended Oxford after fighting for her right to be admitted. After graduating, Hodgkin went to Cambridge for her doctorate. In 1945, she discovered the structure of penicillin, and in the middle of the 1950s she found the structure of Vitamin B12. Hodgkin won the <i> Nobel Prize of Chemisty </i> for her work on Vitamin B12. </p>

	<ol>
		<li> Diabetes Care: Hodgkin's uncovered the complete 3d structure of porcine insulin in 1969, after over three decades of research. The structure of porcine insulin led to further developments in "insulin mutants and analog" according to ALPCO </li>
		<li> Bacterial Infection Care: Hodgkin's discovery of the structure of penicilin allowed scientists and future researchers to create better antibiotics to treat bacterial infections like strep throat and bacterial pneumonia. </li>
