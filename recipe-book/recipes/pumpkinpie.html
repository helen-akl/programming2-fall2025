	<div class="description"

		<p>After my second stepbrother was finished with his turkey and potatoes, I had one more suprise for him: a perfect pumpkin pie! As soon as I pulled this out of the oven, he started tearing up. I asked him what the matter was, and he told me that "pumpkin pie" was the last words of the man he ate (seperate from the armed robbery, please don't ask he's a very private person). Oops! A bit of a faux-pas. Hopefully your guests will enjoy this recipe more than my second stepbrother. </p>
